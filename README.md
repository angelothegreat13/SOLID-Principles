"# SOLID-Principles" 


In PHP, the solid design pattern is a software design principle that defines a set of guidelines for creating maintainable and scalable object-oriented programs. The acronym SOLID stands for the five principles that make up the pattern: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.

#Single Responsibility Principle: This principle states that a class should have only one responsibility, or one reason to change. This means that a class should have a single, well-defined purpose, and all its methods and properties should be related to that purpose.

#Open-Closed Principle: This principle states that a class should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that a class should be designed in such a way that new functionality can be added to it without changing the existing code.

#Liskov Substitution Principle: This principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their superclasses. This means that a program should be able to use a subclass in place of its superclass without causing any errors.

#Interface Segregation Principle: This principle states that a client should not be forced to implement an interface that it does not use. This means that a class should have multiple, specialized interfaces rather than one general-purpose interface.

#Dependency Inversion Principle: This principle states that the high-level modules of a program should not depend on the low-level modules, but rather they should both depend on abstractions. This means that a class should not depend on the specific details of another class, but rather on the abstractions that define their relationship.

Together, these principles can help developers create more maintainable and scalable PHP programs by promoting code reusability, flexibility, and extensibility.
